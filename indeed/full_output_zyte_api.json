We serve new home buyers and new homeowners by ensuring that one of their life’s biggest investments is protected. Almost every new home in the province is covered by a new home warranty. This warranty protection is provided by Ontario’s builders and lasts up to seven years. It is backstopped by Tarion. More than 375,000 homes are currently enrolled in the warranty program. Every year about 55,000 new homes are enrolled.\n\nWith more than 265 employees, Tarion works hard every day to serve the public interest by, first and foremost, protecting consumers and their new home purchases. We investigate homeowner warranty claims; resolve warranty disputes between homeowners and builders; and provide deposit and delayed closing protection for new home buyers. We also manage the Guarantee Fund, an important financial reserve designed to help shield Ontario consumers from possible catastrophic building events. All of this enhances fairness and confidence in Ontario’s new home building industry.\n\nThe Underwriting Team assesses applications to sell and build new residential homes in Ontario, whether these are freehold homes or condominiums. The Underwriting Team also addresses application-related inquiries from Vendors and Builders. The Underwriting process involves assessing the financial and technical risks associated with an application, and proposing the appropriate terms and conditions based on the analysis conducted. Areas of focus include financial risk to assess the feasibility of a project and an applicant's ability to meet warranty obligations; history, to assess past projects and warranty performance; and technical risk, to assess the applicant's technical capabilities vis-a-vis the construction plans proposed. The Underwriting team works in collaboration with various other departments within Tarion to complete risk assessments and to issue terms and conditions.\n\nAs a Junior Underwriter, you are a dynamic, customer-focused individual who thrives in a high- volume, collaborative environment. You are risk-minded and have a background in underwriting. You can analyze financial statements, review legal documentation, and provide a summary and recommendations for risk assessments.\n\nThis is a hybrid role requiring working two (2) days in the office and three (3) days remotely, per week.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\n\nAssist Vendor/Builder in submitting applications on the Tarion online portal, Builderlink, when it is not a system related matter\n\nAssist Vendor/Builder with telephone and email questions about their files and in general about the Underwriting application process\n\nCollect and review application documents from Vendor/Builder\n\nReview financial statements and credit information for certain Vendors/Builders and Indemnitors\n\nProvide support in ad-hoc department projects\n\nAssist with issuing the Terms & condition letters to the Vendor/Builder\n\n\nQualifications:\n\n\nCommunity college diploma\n\nFinancial literacy including basic understanding and ability to interpret a financial statement\n\nProven ability to meet strict deadlines and manage multiple priorities\n\nExperience with conflict resolution to win-win outcomes\n\nExceptional customer service\n\nStrong organizational, analytical and problem solving skills\n\nProficiency in Microsoft Office, Excel and Outlook programs\n\nStrong communication skills: verbal and written\n\nProven ability to work effectively with a variety of audiences and be a team player\n\nDemonstrated ability to balance multiple priorities in a dynamic environment\n\n\nWhy Choose Tarion?\n\nWe believe that Tarion’s employees are its most valuable asset. We strive to provide a welcoming work environment.\n\nWe offer employees a competitive compensation program, opportunities for learning and development, an employee discount program, access to wellness programs, and a variety of Employee Assistance Program tools and online resources to support well-being.\n\nAt Tarion, we believe that a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion allows employees to perform at their very best and underpins a culture in which everyone feels they have an equal opportunity to belong and build a career. Tarion is committed to developing and maintaining work environments and practices that ensure equality of opportunity in recruitment, selection and promotion, and to removing systemic barriers so that employees have every opportunity to feel included in the workplace.\n\nIf you are a person with a disability and have questions or would like help with your application, please contact a member of the Human Resources Department.\n\nApplication Submissions & Deadline:\nPlease submit a covering letter and resume with vacancy code\nJU020623\n.\n\nJob Types: Full-time, Permanent\n\nBenefits:\n\n\nCasual dress\n\nCompany events\n\nCompany pension\n\nDental care\n\nDisability insurance\n\nEmployee assistance program\n\nLife insurance\n\nPaid time off\n\nVision care\n\nWellness program\n\nWork from home\n\n\nSchedule:\n\n\nMonday to Friday\n\n\nSupplemental pay types:\n\n\nBonus pay\n\n\nExperience:\n\n\njunior underwriter: 1 year (required)\n\n\nWork Location: Hybrid remote in Toronto, ON", "listing_page_url_to_crawl": "https://ca.indeed.com/jobs?l=Greater+Toronto+Area%2C+ON&sc=0kf%3Aocc%286YCJB%29%3B&radius=35&sort=date&vjk=f55ce01235a88065&start=390"},
